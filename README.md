Please be prepared to present your work after 2 hours on this. The goal of this exercise is to have a basis for a discussion on your approach and choices when tackling this exercise. It has been intentionally worded very open so you can use whatever tools and approaches you think are best. You are free to use any resources you need and these should be included in the demo and discussion after the test.
